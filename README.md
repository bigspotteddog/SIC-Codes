Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
=========

I could not find a decent list of Standard Industrial Classifications, in a form usable by a computer, I parsed the Department of Labor SIC Manual found here:

http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html

The results are provided in csv and xls format.
